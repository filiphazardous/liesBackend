# Lies Backend!

This is a project to build a simple micro-blog, using Drupal 8 as a headless
backend. The front-end part of the project can be viewed at:
https://github.com/filiphazardous/liesFrontend

Frankly, that's a bit more interesting. However, this backend is configured to
work in a fully headless mode, so if that gives you any trouble just browse
the settings. If everything else fails, feel free to ping me, and I'll help if
I can.
